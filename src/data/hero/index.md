content: "I am an ambivert geek who has been working in Software Development for the past two years. I am a big fan of JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python programming language. I prefer ReactJS/NextJS for building frontend, Redux for managing state, and Express/flask for developing web API. I love to share my development experiences via articles, and you can find them published under the FreeCodeCamp News domain. I am a big fan of Marvel comics."
